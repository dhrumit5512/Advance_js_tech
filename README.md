-Create a file called rectangle.js.
-In the rectangle.js file, define a function called calculateRectangleArea that takes in two arguments: length and width.
-The function should return the product of the length and width. (The product of two or more numbers is the result of multiplying them together. For example, the product of 3 and 4 is 12, because 3 x 4 = 12.)
-Make sure that the calculateRectangleArea function is available for other modules to use with export.
-Create a new file called app.js.
-In the app.js file, use the following code to import the calculateRectangleArea
-function from the rectangle.js module:
####import { calculateRectangleArea } from "./rectangle.js";
-Use the calculateRectangleArea function to calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 5 and a width of 6. Save the result to a variable called area.
-Print the area variable to the console.
